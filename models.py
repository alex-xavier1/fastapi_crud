I understand. You're correct that the provided code snippet doesn't contain any issues. The two import statements are valid and commonly used in Python:

```python
import datetime
import json
```

These lines simply import the `datetime` and `json` modules, which are part of Python's standard library. They don't present any problems on their own.

To provide a more helpful analysis, I would need:

1. The complete code or a larger code snippet that uses these imports
2. Any specific changes made to the code
3. Or a description of the functionality you're trying to implement

If you have any specific concerns or if there's a larger piece of code you'd like me to review, please share it, and I'll be happy to assist you in identifying and fixing any issues.
