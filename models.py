Thank you for providing the issues. I'll fix the code based on the problems you've identified. Here's the corrected version using SQLAlchemy:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
name = Column(String, index=True, nullable=False)
```

This corrected code addresses the following issues:

1. Added a data type (Integer) for the 'id' column.
2. Fixed the capitalization of 'Column' to 'Column'.
3. Corrected the capitalization of 'string' to 'String'.
4. Added the necessary import statement for SQLAlchemy.
5. Completed the column definitions by adding 'primary_key=True' for the 'id' column and 'nullable=False' for the 'name' column.

This code should now work correctly with SQLAlchemy and address all the issues you mentioned. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or explanations.
