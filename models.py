I apologize for the confusion, but it seems there was an error in the message you received. There is no actual code provided for me to fix, only two import statements:

```python
import datetime
import json
```

These import statements are correct and don't have any issues. They're simply importing the `datetime` and `json` modules, which are standard Python libraries.

If you have specific code that needs fixing or if you have any particular issues you'd like addressed, please provide the complete code snippet or describe the problem in more detail. I'll be happy to help you fix any issues once I have more information to work with.
