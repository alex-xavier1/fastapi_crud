# Unit tests for routes.py

The code you provided is not written in Flask, but in FastAPI, which is another Python framework. Here's how to write tests for these endpoints using the FastAPI's built-in test client and pytest. 

```python
# This test module tests the API endpoints defined in the provided module.

from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app
import pytest

client = TestClient(app)

def test_read_items():
    response = client.get("/items")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert isinstance(response.json(), list)

def test_read_item():
    response = client.get("/items/1")
    if response.status_code == 404:
        assert response.json() == {"detail": "Item not found"}
    else:
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert "id" in response.json()
        assert response.json()["id"] == 1

def test_create_item():
    test_item = {"name": "test_item", "description": "This is a test item", "price": 99.99}
    response = client.post("/items", json=test_item)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["name"] == "test_item"

def test_update_item():
    test_item = {"name": "updated_item", "description": "This is an updated item", "price": 99.99}
    response = client.put("/items/1", json=test_item)
    if response.status_code == 404:
        assert response.json() == {"detail": "Item not found"}
    else:
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json()["name"] == "updated_item"

def test_delete_item():
    response = client.delete("/items/1")
    if response.status_code == 404:
        assert response.json() == {"detail": "Item not found"}
    else:
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == {"detail": "Item deleted"}
```

Please note that these tests are simple and straightforward, they do not mock the database interactions and do not cover all possible edge cases. To make them more robust, you could use libraries like pytest-mock or unittest.mock to mock the interactions with the database, and write more tests to cover all possible edge cases, error handling, and boundary conditions.
