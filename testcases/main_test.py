```

This code tests the application setup and a route. It uses the `unittest.mock` library to isolate the modules under test, replacing the `engine.connect`, `FastAPI.include_router`, and `Session.query` methods with mock objects.

The `test_database_initialization` test checks that the database tables are initialized when the app starts. It asserts that the `engine.connect` method is called once.

The `test_routes_included` test checks that the application routes are included in the app. It asserts that the `FastAPI.include_router` method is called with the correct argument.

The `test_get_data_from_database` test checks a route that gets data from the database. It mocks the `Session.query` method to isolate the route from the database. The test asserts that the route returns a 200 status code and that the `Session.query` method is called once.

You can add more tests to check other routes and edge cases. The tests would follow a similar pattern: isolate the module under test with mock objects, call the module, and assert that the expected results are returned or the expected methods are called.
