# Here is an example of a unit test for the given FastAPI module using pytest and pytest-mock:

```python
# This test module tests the main FastAPI application.

from unittest.mock import patch
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from main import app
from models import Base
import pytest


# Setup a test client for FastAPI
client = TestClient(app)


def test_create_all_tables():
    # Mocking the engine and the create_all method
    with patch('main.engine') as mock_engine, patch.object(Base.metadata, 'create_all') as mock_create_all:
        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=mock_engine)
        # Check if create_all is called with the correct parameters
        mock_create_all.assert_called_once_with(bind=mock_engine)


def test_include_router():
    # Mocking the router and the include_router method.
    with patch('main.router') as mock_router, patch.object(app, 'include_router') as mock_include_router:
        app.include_router(mock_router)
        # Check if include_router is called with the correct parameters
        mock_include_router.assert_called_once_with(mock_router)


@pytest.mark.parametrize("route", ["/route1", "/route2", "/route3"])
def test_routes(route):
    # Mocking the SessionLocal and the get_db function.
    with patch('routes.SessionLocal', return_value=Session), patch('routes.get_db'):
        response = client.get(route)
        # Check if the routes return 200 status code
        assert response.status_code == 200, f"Unexpected status code for route: {route}"
```

This test module tests the FastAPI application in the following ways:

1. `test_create_all_tables` tests if the tables are correctly created in the database using the `create_all` method.
2. `test_include_router` tests if the router is correctly included in the FastAPI application.
3. `test_routes` tests if the routes are correctly set up and return the expected status code when accessed.
