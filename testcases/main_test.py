# Unit tests for main.py

Sorry for the misunderstanding, but the code you provided is for a FastAPI application, not a Flask application. They are both Python web frameworks, but they are different and have different testing methods.

However, I can provide you with tests for this FastAPI application using pytest and the starlette testing utilities. Here is an example of a test for this application:

---
```python
# This module contains unit tests for main FastAPI application. It covers tests for initializing database tables, including routes and mocking external dependencies.

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
from starlette.status import HTTP_200_OK
from unittest.mock import patch
from main import app
import pytest
from database import Base

# Create a test client
client = TestClient(app)

# Use in-memory SQLite for tests
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# Mock the sessionmaker for the tests
@patch('database.SessionLocal', new=SessionLocal)
def test_app():
    # Create the database schema
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    
    # Test a GET request to the root endpoint
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == HTTP_200_OK
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello, World!"}

    # Test a POST request to the root endpoint
    response = client.post("/", json={"key": "value"})
    assert response.status_code == HTTP_200_OK
    assert response.json() == {"key": "value"}

# This is an example of a boundary test
def test_large_request():
    large_request = {'key': 'value' * 1000000}
    response = client.post("/", json=large_request)
    assert response.status_code == HTTP_200_OK

# This is an example of an edge case test
def test_no_data_request():
    response = client.post("/", json={})
    assert response.status_code == HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST

# This is an example of a test for error handling
def test_non_json_request():
    response = client.post("/", data="This is not JSON")
    assert response.status_code == HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
```

Please note that these tests are based on a hypothetical set of routes and responses, and you would need to adapt them to the actual routes and responses of your application. Also, these tests assume that the application is using SQLAlchemy for its database, and that the database session is available at 'database.SessionLocal'. You would need to adjust this to match your actual application setup.
