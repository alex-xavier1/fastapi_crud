Based on the issues you've described, I'll provide suggestions to fix the naming conventions and improve clarity:

1. Use consistent naming convention:
   - For camelCase: databaseUser, databaseUserId
   - For snake_case: database_user, database_user_id

2. Clarify the distinction between user and user ID:
   - If they represent different concepts:
     databaseUser (or database_user)
     databaseUserId (or database_user_id)
   - If they are the same concept, use only one:
     databaseUserId (or database_user_id)

3. Improve specificity if needed:
   - If there are multiple types of users:
     applicationDatabaseUser (or application_database_user)
     applicationDatabaseUserId (or application_database_user_id)

4. Follow language-specific conventions:
   - For Java-like languages:
     databaseUser
     databaseUserId
   - For Python-like languages:
     database_user
     database_user_id

5. Ensure consistent capitalization:
   - Avoid capitalizing the first letter unless it's a class name

Here's a summary of the improved versions:

For camelCase (e.g., Java):
databaseUser
databaseUserId

For snake_case (e.g., Python):
database_user
database_user_id

Remember to choose the convention that best fits your programming language and project standards. Also, ensure that the chosen names accurately represent the data or concept they're meant to describe.
