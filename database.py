Thank you for providing the context. I understand that you're looking for a coding assistant to fix issues in the given code. However, the snippet you provided doesn't contain any actual code changes or issues to fix. It only shows two import statements:

```python
import json
import models
```

These import statements by themselves are not problematic. They're simply importing the `json` module (a standard Python library) and a module called `models` (which is likely a custom module in your project).

Without seeing the original code, more context, or specific issues to address, there's nothing to fix in this snippet. 

If you have any specific concerns or if there's more code that you'd like me to review and fix, please provide:

1. The original code before any changes
2. The complete updated code
3. Any specific issues or errors you're encountering
4. Any additional context about what the code is supposed to do

With this information, I'd be able to identify and fix any actual issues in the code.
