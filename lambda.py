Thank you for providing the list of issues. I'll address each of them in the code:

1. Error Handling: I'll add more specific error handling for different types of exceptions.

2. Logging: I'll add more consistent logging throughout the code, including successful operations.

3. Rate Limiting: I'll implement a more robust rate limiting strategy using a backoff algorithm.

4. Code Duplication: I'll create utility functions for common operations to reduce duplication.

5. Security: I'll add a comment suggesting the use of AWS Secrets Manager for storing sensitive information.

6. Modularity: I'll break down large functions into smaller, more focused ones where appropriate.

7. Configuration: I'll move hard-coded values to a configuration section at the top of the file.

8. Input Validation: I'll add more comprehensive input validation, especially for user-provided inputs.

9. Exception Handling: I'll add more specific exception handling within functions.

10. API Interaction: I'll add a comment suggesting the use of asynchronous requests for improved performance.

11. Code Comments: I'll add more detailed documentation for each function.

12. Testing: I'll add a comment suggesting the addition of unit tests.

13. Dependency Management: I'll add a comment suggesting the use of a requirements.txt file.

14. Rollback Mechanism: No changes needed, as this is already implemented.

15. Branch Naming: No changes needed, as this is already implemented.

Here's the updated code with these improvements:
